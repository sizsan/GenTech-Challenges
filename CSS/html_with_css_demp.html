    <p>RYAN: Hello MTV Cribs. Welcome to my home. First let me show you the living room. This is where we relax and watch TV, you know, hang out, read a magazine or a book or whatever.
         This is the TV. I think it's a 21-incher. It's color. I watch a lot of TV. I've got a Playstation 2, but I mostly just use it to play DVDs.
          I'm not that into video games. Over here you can see my halogen lamp. 
          We use the halogen lamp in here because the overhead lighting is kind of dim, and sometimes you just want it bright. You know, when you are reading or something.
          Let me show you where we eat. This is the dining area. It just kind of flows into the living room. It's a little cramped in here now because we bought a regular-size kitchen table and this space isn't really big enough to handle it. 
          So we have to squeeze by it whenever we go in or out of the kitchen. But that's ok. You can see some bills on the table. 
          That's to remind us that we need to pay them. We pass by this table, like two dozen times a day, so it's a pretty good system. And now, the kitchen.
